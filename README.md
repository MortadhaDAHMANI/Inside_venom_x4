Tuact Venom X4 PS4/Xbox One/Xbox 360/PS3/PC

Base on the most popular and the bestselling Venom-X mouse controller, Tuact has redesigned and created the all-new Venom-X4. In additional to all the features that Venom-X has, the new Venom-X4 has many significant improvements and upgrades that will elevate your level of gameplay - faster, more accurate and more comfortable to use!

The new Venom-X4 supports not only SONY PS4, PS3, XBox360, XBox One and Windows PC but also all the newer models of Playstation and Xbox – PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, and Xbox One S. Tuact will continuously keep upgrading of the Venom-X4’s firmware whenever a new console or model is released.

Tuact have developed the new version of the Tuact Guidance System. The TGS-II has optimized the tracking precision by maximum 10%. It will also bring more positioning accuracy with slow micro-movements as well as the top speed turning.   

The new Venom-X4 mouse has been upgraded with a 12000CPI sensor, 250IPS max speed and has 50g acceleration. Gamers can turn further and faster with less hand  movement.

The Setup process was only available on Windows PC in the past. The newly creative Wi-Fi solution will release you from running back & forth between your console & PC, you can update the profiles and adjust the settings at the console site while you are in the game.
